[ It was a very challenging assignment — obviously the final one. I completed it within 4.5 days, during exams and EJP, and faced many issues along the way. Unfortunately, I couldn't submit the assignment on time, for 60 marks. Now I am submitting it for 50 marks.
The admin, seller, and user roles were new to me, and due to limited time, I couldn't focus much on design. Still, it was a valuable experience, and I’m grateful for the final assignment—it pushed me to learn and apply a lot quickly. Thanks for this last assignment.]
